                        Wrote more paper implementations and pushed to the repository. Took over as president

                        Didn't do work much due to my hectic schedule. Got an internship 
                        at Swimlane to work as a Machine Learning intern for Summer 2024.

                        It was at this time that I took Machine Learning more seriously, and extensively played around 
                        with SAM and YOLO models, as well as fundamentals of Computer Vision.

            I'm not a huge fan of using too many libraries just to create a portfolio.
